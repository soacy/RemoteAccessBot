## unium grabber info

**Please make sure you edit your "token" and "prefix" in the *grabber.py* file.**

**NOTE:** THIS GRABBER IS ALL CONTROLLED IN DISCORD SO YOU WILL NEED A DISCORD BOT FOR THE INFORMATION TO SEND TO YOU!
**ADDITIONAL NOTE:** YOU WILL NEED PYTHON v3.12.1 FOR THIS!! (pyscreeze relys on a specific version of pillow) (Pillow version i'm using: 10.2.0)

What this grabber does is, once ran it will take your victims system information, network information, screen shot of their desktop.
You can also do commands like *.proclist* to see the running processes on your victims pc!

## Don't know what your doing?

**Are you stuck / lost? This little guide will help..**

**First:** Start off by creating a discord bot if you dont have one already. And if you dont have python installed you should totally do that..

- [Discord Docs AKA Where you create a bot](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro)

**Second:** Edit the token value *grabber.py* file to your discord bots token. *(you can also adjust the prefix too!)*

**Last Step:** Run the *setup.bat* file! That bacth file will insall all nessesary python packages and build your grabber into a exe for you!
